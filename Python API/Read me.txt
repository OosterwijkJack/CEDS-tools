First drag the "Python API" folder into the desired directory

you will have to also run the following commands to get the program to work

pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager

Then once that is done watch the video I made showing how it works.
You still have to run the server before using and the server now has the 
goverment invoice program and the cc generator program all in one so you dont
need to run any extra files.
